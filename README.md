# My journey to Rust

Rust is a powerful language. It brings the pleasure of coding a high-level language without sacrificing safety and speed. I'm amazed by what we can do with this language. It's been a pleasure to study and learn Rust after working with Javascript for the past 5 years. (I still love Javascript ðŸ’›)

But there is one detail...Rust's steep learning curve. (Don't feel discouraged!).
I don't think the language itself is hard to learn. I feel like the more you progress in your studies the more you want to learn. The syntax is pleasant to the eyes, but the difficulty starts when you need to use more advanced pieces of the language (and in my opinion is where its power lives) and a lot of terms from systems programming arise and you have no idea how to overcome them.

I've learned about such terms during college: pointers, references, stack, heap, memory, bounds, how float numbers work, bits, bytes, etc., but I've been working with Javascript and React for the past years and to be honest you don't even touch these areas because Javascript manages all that for you at the cost of speed and safety as it's an interpreted language.

Do you know that pain of having `cannot find something of undefined` in production? Yes, that doesn't happen with Rust. `Rustc`, its compiler, is powerful.
My learning fight is being a journey of happiness and disappointment. I am happy because even though I'm learning Rust I can already understand its power and sometimes I'm frustrated because I've been reading a lot of books and when it reaches more advanced concepts I am left behind because the authors just start using `Box, Arc, RefCell` and just mention what they are, but to understand what they are you need to understand or at least remember a lot of how machines work under the hood and I am sometimes left behind.


But I have decided: I'm not giving up!

This repo is a tentative of documenting my learning journey until I feel comfortable using Rust. I'm gonna be using [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) available for free.

My plan is to go chapter by chapter and code while I learn. I'll be summarizing and commenting on the chapters as I go to practice and have a more active learning journey rather than just reading and creating some variables.
Whenever it is possible I'll be comparing some stuff with Javascript's ecosystem in a tentative of bridging the gap between Rust and my universe. I hope that can help you too.
Summary and general comments regarding concepts I struggled to understand will be in a readme file. I'll try to provide additional links with sources that helped me to understand such concepts.
Please, feel free to contribute and add your impressions. 

Thanks for reading this book and let's learn!
